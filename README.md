# BitbyBit

The System forms a secure and transparent __blockchain-powered framework__ for crowdfunding. This platform provides following benefits:
* Backers will be better protected from financial loss and more likely to receive product.
* Creators will receive more support for their project with lower fees and overall cost.
* The Crowd will financially rewarded for applying their skills and knowledge.
* Smart Contracts will increase transparency on platform and will ensure creators get paid after delivering on promised milestone.

A native token will be used to exchange goods and services on the platform and enable blockchain features. 

## Problem 
The main problem facing crowdfunding is issue of trust. Backers are repeatedly burned down by creators who fail to follow on their promises. Backers wait for months(sometimes years) to receive made promises, whereas the project creators get completely funded immediately. 

## Solution
The Distributed nature of Blockchain and the use of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts allow the network to grow, self-govern, and distribute in open and merit-based way. BitbyBit focuses on product-based crowdfunding rather than equity-based crowdfunding.

BitbyBit offers a Backer Insurance - a security mechanism that holds campaign funds in smart contract governed by backer vote.
This financial incentive holds creators accountable to their promised timelines and provides a basic security mechanism for backers.
